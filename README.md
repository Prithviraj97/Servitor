# Servitor
The purpose of this project was to design an autonomous vehicle that can travel from node to node solving a puzzle. A map is coded into the program and once executed the program will tell robot where to go. It uses BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from one node to another. The robot as now hasn't been able to do left pivot. We have used L298N Dual H-bridge motor driver to control the speed of motor.
